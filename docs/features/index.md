# Features Overview

ModEx is packed with features designed to make mod management effortless. Here's what sets it apart.

## Core Philosophy

ModEx uses a **metadata-only architecture**. Instead of downloading and storing mod files, it stores references to mods on CurseForge. This approach offers:

- ⚡ **Lightweight** — Your library stays small regardless of mod count
- 🔄 **Always Fresh** — Information is fetched directly from CurseForge
- 💾 **Easy Backup** — Your entire library is a small JSON file
- 🚀 **Fast Exports** — Generate modpacks for any launcher in seconds

## Feature Highlights
