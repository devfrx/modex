# Library

The Library is your central hub for managing all mods, resource packs, and shaders. It provides powerful search, filtering, and organization tools.

## Overview

The Library view displays all content you've added to ModEx. Each item shows:
- **Name** and **Author**
- **Game Version** and **Loader** (Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, Quilt)
- **Content Type** indicator (mod, resource pack, shader)
- **Modpack usage** — which modpacks include this item

## View Modes

Toggle between different layouts using the toolbar buttons:

- **Grid View** — Card layout with mod icons
- **List View** — Compact rows for scanning many items
- **Gallery View** — Large thumbnails for visual browsing

## Search & Filters

### Quick Search

Press `Ctrl + F` or click the search bar to filter by:
- Mod name
- Author name
- Description

### Advanced Filters

Click the **Filter** button to access:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Loader** | All, Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, Quilt |
| **Game Version** | Any version in your library |
| **Content Type** | All, Mods, Resource Packs, Shaders |
| **Modpack** | All, Any modpack, No modpack, or specific modpack |
| **Folder** | Filter by your folder organization |

### Search Field

Narrow your search to specific fields:
- **All** — Search everything

Favorites are stored locally and persist across sessions.

## Duplicate Detection

ModEx automatically detects duplicate mods (same mod, different versions or loaders):

- Duplicates are highlighted with a warning indicator
- Use this to clean up your library or identify version conflicts

Select multiple items for batch operations:

1. `Ctrl + Click` to add/remove from selection

3. `Ctrl + A` to select all visible items

With items selected, the **Bulk Action Bar** appears:

- **Add to Modpack** — Add selected items to a modpack
- **Move to Folder** — Organize into a folder
- **Delete** — Remove from library
