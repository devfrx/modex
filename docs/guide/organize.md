# Organize

The Organize view provides a file-manager-like interface to structure your mod library with folders and hierarchies.

## Folder Structure

Create a logical organization for your mods:

```
📁 Performance
   ├── Sodium
   ├── Lithium
   └── Starlight
📁 Magic
   ├── 📁 Thaumcraft
   │   ├── Thaumcraft Core
   │   └── Thaumcraft Additions
   └── Botania
📁 Tech
   └── ...
```

## Creating Folders

1. Go to **Organize** view
2. Click **New Folder** button
3. Enter a folder name
4. Choose a color (optional)
5. Click **Create**

### Nested Folders

Create subfolders by:
1. Right-click an existing folder
2. Select **New Subfolder**
3. Name the subfolder

Or drag a folder onto another folder to nest it.

## View Modes

### Tree View

The default hierarchical view showing:
- Folder tree on the left
- Folder contents on the right
- Breadcrumb navigation

### Grid View

A flat view for working with the current folder's contents:
- Large mod cards
- Quick filtering
- Drag-and-drop organization

Toggle between views using the buttons in the toolbar.

## Moving Mods

### Drag and Drop

1. Select one or more mods
2. Drag onto a folder
3. Drop to move

### Context Menu

1. Right-click a mod
2. Select **Move to Folder**
3. Choose destination

### Bulk Move

1. Select multiple mods (`Ctrl + Click`)
2. Right-click selection
3. Choose **Move to Folder**

## Folder Properties

Right-click a folder to access:

- **Rename** — Change folder name
- **Change Color** — Update the color indicator
- **Move** — Relocate within hierarchy
- **Delete** — Remove folder (mods return to root)

## Content Type Filtering

The toolbar includes filters for:

- **All** — Show everything
- **Mods** — Only mods
- **Resource Packs** — Only resource packs
- **Shaders** — Only shaders

Combined with folder selection, quickly find what you need.

## Unorganized Mods

Mods not in any folder appear in the **Unorganized** section. Use this to:
- Identify mods needing organization
- Drag them into appropriate folders
- Clean up your library structure

## Tips

- Use **colors** to visually categorize folders (red for incompatible, green for tested, etc.)
- Create a **"To Test"** folder for new additions
- Use nested folders for mod families (e.g., Create and its addons)
