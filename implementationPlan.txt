Remote Modpack Collaboration & Updates
This plan addresses the user's request for a system to share and update modpacks between collaborators or a master-slave model, specifically aiming for a free hosting solution. We will implement a Remote Manifest system where a "Master" modpack can be exported to a JSON file, hosted on a public URL (like GitHub Gist), and "Clients" can subscribe to this URL for updates.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Hosting Strategy: This feature relies on the user hosting the generated Manifest JSON file on a public URL. We recommend using GitHub Gists (raw view) or a similar service. The app will fetch this URL to check for updates.

Proposed Changes
Data Layer (
src/types/index.ts
)
[MODIFY] 
index.ts
Add remote_source property to 
Modpack
 interface:
remote_source?: {
  url: string;
  auto_check: boolean;
  last_checked?: string;
};
Services (electron/services & src/services)
[NEW] 
RemoteUpdateService.ts
 (Frontend)
checkForUpdates(modpack: Modpack): Promise<UpdateResult>
applyUpdate(modpack: Modpack, update: UpdateResult): Promise<void>
This service will:
Fetch the JSON from modpack.remote_source.url.
Compare the remote version and updated_at with the local modpack.
If newer, generate a diff (mods added, removed, versions changed).
UI Components
[MODIFY] 
ModpackSettings.vue
Add a section "Collaboration / Remote Updates".
Input field for Remote Manifest URL.
Toggle for Auto-check updates.
Button: "Export Manifest for Hosting" (generates the JSON to clipboard/file).
[NEW] 
UpdateAvailableBanner.vue
A banner shown in the Modpack View when an update is detected.
Shows "Update Available: v1.0.1 -> v1.0.2".
Button: "Review & Update".
[NEW] 
UpdateReviewDialog.vue
Functionality to show the diff:
New Mods: List mods to be added.
Removed Mods: List mods to be removed.
Updates: Show version changes.
"Confirm Update" button.
Verification Plan
Manual Verification
Export: Create a dummy modpack "Master", add some mods. Use "Export Manifest" in settings. Save the JSON.
Host: Upload the JSON to a GitHub Gist (public) and get the "Raw" URL.
Subscribe: Create a second modpack "Client" (empty or clone). Go to settings, paste the Raw URL.
Check: Click "Check for Updates". It should say "Up to date" (if versions match) or "Update available" (if we tweak the local version down).
Simulate Update: Edit the Gist, add a fake mod or change version.
Verify Update: Click check again in "Client". Verify the "Review Update" dialog appears with correct diff. Apply update and verify mods are added.
